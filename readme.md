### What is _Future of Sleep_?

The Future of Sleep is an application that could help determine the amount of sleep you take and give you insight on how your brain behaves during the REM period.

In the app you will be able to select the amount of time you want to sleep by using the corresponding sleeping device.

According to research in this science field, you can trick the brain into thinking that you have slept for eight hours while you only had four hours of sleep by manipulating brainwaves.


### How does this work?

In the application, you connect the device and then select the amount of time you want to sleep. After that, a timer will start counting down from five minutes to zero. During this time period, the device will gradually decrease your brain activity which will make you fall asleep after the timer is done.


### Implications solved through design ethics

One of the implications that we want to prevent is that people will abuse the application to sleep much more than is desirable (which is around eight hours a day). A way to stop people from misusing the app is to only provide them a limited amount of days to use it during the week.

Another implication could be that malicious people want to hack the corresponding sleeping device and mess around with the user's sleeping pattern. Imagine someone using the app like the President of the United States. People that want to do harm could mess with his sleep.

The side effects from the device are currently unknown, but it is possible that using the app too much will affect the user mentally and physically. To keep up with the user's health, the app will  periodically send 'check ups' to keep up with the user. This gives big insights in the possible side effects of the device and the app.

## To-Do list
Pages we are making:

- [ ]	Pop-up / warning
- [ ]	Introduction
  - [ ] The phone needs to be in the charger
  - [ ] Battery status of the phone and head device.

- [ ]	Alarm clock / timer
	- [ ]	set the time for the application.
	- [ ]	Touch ID event/popup to start the app.

- [ ] After the timer
    - [ ] Show how much hours/minutes you have slept.
    - [ ] How many hours you can be productive now.
    - [ ] The button is disabled after this because you already used the app.


Parked for now
- Slider for the ringtone volume (doesn't really add that much)
- You can set up a sound for the waiting time to have some soothing sounds to fall a sleep to.
- Data analyzation.
